                            <p>I have over 10+ years of experience in the Software Development space, with roles in both Quality Assurance and Web Development. 
                                While QA is definitely an important aspect of the SDLC, and I have learned many things through my years as QA Engineer, my interest 
                                has always been within the Development component of the life cycle.</p>

                            <p>My software career started with Business Objects (an SAP company), performing QA for a desktop application aimed at building usable business dashboards.</p> 
                            
                            <p>But, my <em>Web Development</em> career had not taken off until I joined Zovio (formerly Bridgepoint Education). This is where I was exposed to the web dev world 
                                by working with Web Developers doing QA on a number of Marketing-based websites. While doing testing, I always had a curiosity on how things had worked under the hood. 
                                Eventually, my curiosity and willingness to learn presented me with the opportunity of being a Software Developer and doing dev work on the sites that I had previously tested.</p>

                            <p>As a Software Developer with Zovio, I worked on a variety of web applications. These included Marketing-based websites designed to attract 
                                organic leads, a lead management application, and I also had the opportunity to take the lead on our university online application portal.</p>

                            <p>My most recent role lead me to working with ServiceNow, where I was part of a QA team that was responsible for testing newly revamped user interfaces of the ServiceNow 
                                platform.</p>

                            <p>I currently spend my free time keeping my development skills sharp by working on personal web projects geared towards my own personal hobbies and interests. But outside of the software world,
                                I enjoy watching live sports, including <a href="https://www.nba.com/" target="_blank">NBA</a>, 
                                <a href="https://www.mlb.com/" target="_blank">MLB</a>, and <a href="https://www.formula1.com/" target="_blank">Formula 1</a>. 
                                I also enjoy the outdoors, spending time with my wife and our dog, and working on my cars.</p>

                                    a new lead generation management/tracking tool to promote cost savings to the company. Towards the 
                                    latter part of my tenure, I was tasked with enhancing and maintaining the company student online

                                    variety of defects for the company's CRM system, automated nightly job processes, and front-end microsites. I worked 
                                    closely with Software Developers and System Engineers with post-deployment validation during scheduled deployments.</p>
