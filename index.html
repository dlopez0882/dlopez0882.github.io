          <h3>Software Developer</h3>
          <p>I have over 10+ years of experience in the Software Development space, with roles in both Quality Assurance and Web Development. While QA is definitely an important aspect of the SDLC, and I have learned many things through my years as QA Engineer, my interest has always been within the Development component of the life cycle.</p>
          <p>My software career started with Business Objects (an SAP company), performing QA for a desktop application aimed at building usable business dashboards.</p>
          <p>But, my Web Development career had not taken off until I joined Zovio (formerly Bridgepoint Education). This is where I was exposed to the web dev world by working with Web Developers doing QA on a number of Marketing-based websites. While doing testing, I always had a curiosity on how things had worked under the hood. Eventually, my curiosity and willingness to learn presented me with the opportunity of being a Software Developer and doing dev work on the sites that I had previously tested.</p>
          <p>As a Software Developer with Zovio, I worked on a variety of web applications. These included Marketing-based websites designed to attract organic leads, a lead management application, and I also had the opportunity to take the lead on our university online application portal.</p>
          <p>After my time with Zovio, I was given the opportunity at ServiceNow, where I was part of a QA team that was responsible for testing newly revamped user interfaces of the ServiceNow platform.</p>
          <p>In my most recent and current role as Web Developer at Kauffman and Associates, Inc., I was presented with an opportunity to develop a modernized version of the company's "work order system". Starting from the ground up, the goal was to migrate away from a legacy application which had an outdated UI. In turn, this has helped internal employees seamlessly manage their day-to-day duties with a more modern, user-friendly interface. Since the goal was to modernize the application, the front-end stack of choice was Vue.js/Nuxt.js using Vuetify.</p>
          <p>I currently spend my free time keeping my development skills sharp by working on personal web projects geared towards my own personal hobbies and interests. But outside of the software world, I enjoy watching live sports, including <a href="https://www.nba.com/" target="_blank">NBA</a>, <a href="https://www.mlb.com/" target="_blank">MLB</a>, and <a href="https://www.formula1.com/" target="_blank">Formula 1</a>. I also enjoy the outdoors, spending time with my wife and our dog, and working on my cars.</p>
          <p>Please see my <a href="#resume" class="scroll-to-hash-link">work experience</a> to learn more about me.</p>

                When starting at Bridgepoint Education, I had the opportunity to work with David from the beginning. To sum up - he learns fast. Selfishly, I think what's made him so reliable for me is his level of detail on thinking of all edge cases, regardless of how obvious or obscure they may seem. Coming from a QA Analyst background definitely helped in his foundation as a developer.<br/><br/>
                In our time working together, he's illustrated patience when troubleshooting a problem and his front-end development skills have taken shape. BPIE put him into a position where he is very much a &quot;plug-and-play&quot; kind of candidate. He adapts very quickly, which is what I miss most about having him on my team.

                I would like to take the opportunity to offer a formal recommendation for David Lopez. In my role as a software developer for Bridgepoint Inc, I have had the pleasure of working closely with David for the past year on major efforts for several different applications.<br/><br/>
                When testing my software changes, David's meticulous attention to details and awareness of application boundaries has certainly increased the quality of the software that is being pushed out. There have been countless times where I've missed a particular condition only to have David humbly tell me what was missing.<br/><br/>
                He actively engages himself in the software development process by ensuring that he fully understands the environment and test conditions for what he is testing. He also makes himself available to answer any questions which he does so promptly and effectively.<br/><br/>
                David is often praised by his superiors as being an effective team player. He has quickly become the resource of choice when developing any major change.<br/><br/>
                I am convinced that David would be an excellent addition to your team and would personally welcome a phone call or email to further discuss his qualifications. Thank you.

                David Lopez is my colleague at Bridgepoint education since 2011. During that time he proved to be incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. Working on numerous software projects and enhancements together, he has shown strategic thinking and problem solving abilities. His knowledge of advanced QA methodologies and programming practices was a great asset to the team. With his great determination, attention to detail and goal-oriented attitude, he excelled as a Quality Assurance Engineer.<br/><br/>
                One key project I can recall working with him on with was on an aggressive marketing initiative to roll out a re-design of the company’s primary website. In a short time frame he was able to identify and help debug numerous software issues. His attention to detail in testing not only positive workflow scenarios but numerous boundary and negative test cases assured the system was of good quality. His ability to quickly learn was also shown when tasked with load testing a system with little prior knowledge of MS Load Test. With only a couple short demos with him, he quickly picked up the tool and scripted a robust load test script.<br/><br/>  
                I would highly recommend David and his work to any company interested in pursuing his services.
