								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/developer.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>It all started with a Spring semester internship at a small software company where 
                                I was responsible for testing a desktop application that was aimed at building usable 
                                dashboards. I was continuously amazed not only with the product, but with the process of
                                actually being involved with building software.</p>

                            <p>Since then, I have worked with several companies including, Business Objects (an SAP company),
                                Intuit, Zovio (former Bridgepoint Education), and more recently, ServiceNow.</p>

                            <p>While I've had a number of Software QA roles in the past, I've also worn the Software Developer hat. 
                                I've worked on variety of web applications, including Marketing-based websites designed to attract 
                                organic leads, a lead management application, and a university online application portal.</p>
                            
                            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy watching live sports, including <a href="https://www.nba.com/" target="_blank">NBA</a>, 
                                <a href="https://www.mlb.com/" target="_blank">MLB</a>, and <a href="https://www.formula1.com/" target="_blank">Formula 1</a>. 
                                I also enjoy the outdoors, spending time with my dog, and working on my cars.</p>

                                    latter part of my tenure, I was tasked with enhancing and maintaining the company student online
